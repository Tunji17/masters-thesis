She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region.

Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.\n",

(We resected three ribs where the 8th and 10th ribs were macroscopically free of the tumor. The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.)

The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place.

Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report.

He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient.

The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure.

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.\n",

      "Doctor: I see. Your motor and sensory exam is normal at the hand, right?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: Alright. We have taken some radiographs of your forearm and elbow. They showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: After your fall, you developed a hypertrophic nonunion of your ulnar shaft fracture, and we treated it with a cast for three months. But your motion through the nonunion site worsened, and you were unhappy with the functional limitations of your elbow arthrodesis.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: We discussed the surgical options for the ulna nonunion with you at your clinic visit three months after the fall, and we decided to proceed with conservative treatment for an additional three months.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I remember.\n",
      "Doctor: Due to your prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as the risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of the nonunion and the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would act as an intramedullary device.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, I understand.\n",
      "Doctor: During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position and a posterior incision was performed over your elbow. We had to elevate a prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at your index procedure. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: We performed a triceps splitting approach to your elbow joint and multiple buried pins were inserted.\n",
      "Patient: Alright.\n",
      "Doctor: Is there anything you don't understand or have any questions about the procedure?\n",
      "Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: You're welcome. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 23-year-old married female presented to our outpatient department with complaints of swelling of the vulva and ulcers on the perineal folds for 5 years. The swelling started in 2011 during 1st trimester of gestation, which was gradually progressive (1–5 cm in size). Few painless ulcers developed on the inner aspect of both thighs after 1 year, which gradually increased in number and size. Gradually, she developed pain in the perineum. There was no history of preceding fever, chronic cough, weight loss, oral ulcers, loose stool, and blood in stool. She gave a history of cesarean section, which was performed due to genital prolapse. Then, she was operated for prolapse, and later, biopsy was taken from the swelling to rule out postoperative lymphangioma. The biopsy showed nonspecific granulomas and chronic infiltrates. She was started on oral azathioprine, antibiotics, metronidazole, and steroids with some improvement in groin ulcers and a decrease in vulvar edema and induration. She was on and off treatment for past 3 years with partial relief at best. Meanwhile, she took antituberculosis treatment for 3 months from the gynecology department of a tertiary hospital but did not show any improvement.\\nThe condition worsened, and the patient presented in our OPD with complaints of vulval swelling, fissuring, and typical “knife-cut” ulcers, as shown in .\\nOn examination, an irregular firm, lobulated swelling arising from the vulva was appreciated. There were multiple, oval to linear, typical knife cutting deep ulcers with well-demarcated margins, of size varying from 0.5 to 5 cm. The ulcers were tender and showed fresh bleeding.\\nWe repeated a biopsy which showed epithelioid cell granuloma in the dermis with dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes and plasma cells, as shown in . Special stains for acid-fast bacillus and reticulin were noncontributory. Our differential diagnosis at this stage included vulvar CD, cutaneous tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, deep fungal infection, and lymphogranuloma venereum.\\nColonoscopic biopsy was done from the terminal ileum, which showed only mild inflammatory changes without any features of granulomatous disease. Colonoscopy was normal. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (both p ANCA and c ANCA) and anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies were negative. Routine hematological investigations and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were within the normal range. Hepatitis B surface antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test were negative. Tissue fungal culture was negative. The chest X-ray was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showed vulvar edema with soft-tissue thickening within superficial subcutaneous layer extending up to the perineum likely inflammatory. In view of the clinical and histopathological features and all other investigations, a diagnosis of CD of the external genitalia was made by the exclusion.\\nIn view of the previous nonresponse, we planned to start biologic therapy in form of injection adalimumab 160 mg (8/8/16)–80 mg (22/8/16)–40 mg (6/9/16) s/c at an interval of 2 weeks for 1 year, along with azathioprine 50 mg bid.\\nThere was significant healing of the ulcers after six cycles of adalimumab, as shown in .\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 62-year-old male patient with liver cirrhosis due to HCV infection since 1993 was found to have HCC in 2003 and underwent caudate lobe resection. After surgery, he received antiviral therapy, with a sustained virological response to antiviral therapy by interferon plus ribavirin. Four months after the liver resection the patient was found to have HCC recurrence in the liver, and during the next 3 years, he consequentially received several TAE/TACE procedures for HCC in S2, S4 and S7, percutaneous ethanol injection for HCC in S7 and RFA for HCC in S2, with good clinical and roentgenological outcomes.\\nThirty-eight months after the initial finding of HCC, the patient underwent LDLT from his daughter, using a left lobe graft, and his treatment followed the general clinical protocol of the center, including immunosuppressive therapy. A few days before transplantation, the patient's prognostic criteria presented with CTP class C (10 points), a MELD score of 10 points and HCC within the Milan criteria. The tumor marker levels were normal: AFP 1.9 ng/dl and PIVKA II 24 mAU/ml. Histopathological study of the explanted liver showed no evidence of malignancy.\\nHowever, with elevation of AFP 19 months after LT, a single nodule of peritoneal tumor in the pelvic cavity was observed under PET/CT. Within 1 month the patient underwent peritoneal tumor resection, and histopathological investigation of the tumor revealed moderately differentiated HCC. After 3 months, the patient was accepted for adjuvant therapy with sorafenib 400 mg, but at the same time, he was observed to have recurrence of the pelvic tumor, with invasion in the rectum, and it was noted that he also had liver recurrence. TACE was performed for both the pelvis and liver tumors, and thereafter the patient was supported with palliative treatment. After about 1 month of this treatment, the patient asked to be discharged so he could go home, where he died within 3 months. Overall, the patient survived 46 months after LT. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy was under cyclosporine with the trough level of 50–100 ng/μl without any signs of rejection. This case was partly reported in our previous publication [].\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: The patient was a 26-year-old female with a chief complaint of epigastric pain since one year previous. Anorexia, heartburn, sensation of postparandial fullness, nausea-vomiting, early satiety and a 10 kg weight loss were among the other signs and symptoms experienced over the previous year. She was prescribed omeprazol and clidinium C with no significant improvement. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of worsening symptoms. On physical examination, the vital signs were stable, with no abnormal findings observed in the lungs, heart and extremities. The epigastric area was tender without guarding or detection of a mass. During her hospital course, the patient had two episodes of melena. Laboratory data were remarkable for the following results ().\\nThe patient underwent an endoscopic evaluation. The results indicated a large friable mass with tumoral features in the body, antrum, and prepyloric areas of the stomach which was invaginated into the bulb and the second portion of the duodenum (). The endoscopist recommended a barium meal and/or abdominal contrast CT scan. The barium study was remarkable for enlarged gastric folds and varying sizes of multiple filling defects in the distal stomach that continued into the whole parts of the duodenum (). In order to relieve the obstruction, surgical interventions were planned. During the surgery, the surgeon observed large polypoid lesions in the stomach that lead to gastroduodenal intussusception. A distal partial gastrectomy and intussusception release was performed.\\nThe gross appearance of stomach wall resembled cerebral convolutions and there was diffuse involvement of the stomach (). The major histopathologic findings in the gastric specimen included foveolar cell hyperplasia, cystic gland changes, and glands that penetrated into the muscularis mucosa. There were significantly diminished parietal cells noted on histologic examination (). No evidence of malignancy was found in multiple histologic sections. These in addition to other clinical and paraclinical findings were all suggestive for diffuse type Ménétrier’s disease.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 50-year-old man was recruited for participation in a clinical trial examining the effect of dietary glutamate on fibromyalgia and IBS symptoms. All subjects were asked to report all symptoms that they were experiencing at baseline, then after 4 weeks on the dietary intervention, and at the end of each challenge week. In addition to his fibromyalgia and IBS symptoms, this man additionally reported OCD symptoms. He reported that he had experienced his OCD symptoms daily since he was 11 years old, and that they had always been nonresponsive to treatment. His obsessions revolved around the need to perfect certain movements, and his compulsions included the repetition of activities such as repeatedly getting up and down from a chair, in and out of the shower, etc. These compulsions took up a significant amount of time per day and interfered with his daily activities, including his ability to hold down a job.\\nThe 50-year-old subject had undergone multiple unsuccessful pharmacological OCD treatments over the 39 years he had been experiencing symptoms. During his participation in the fibromyalgia study he was not currently taking medication for any of his symptoms (due to reportedly not tolerating the side effects of medications). Participation by individuals with a comorbid mental health diagnosis was deemed ethical by the research team and university IRB under certain circumstances. While individuals in acute mental health distress (e.g., active psychosis) were excluded from the study, participants with a mental health diagnosis that was stable for the past 6 months were eligible for participation.\\nDetails about the study and overall results of this clinical trial in which he participated have been published previously []. However, a brief overview of the study design is included here ().\\nAfter recruitment, all subjects received in-depth training on how to follow a 1-month low-glutamate diet, which restricted intake of common flavor enhancing food additives with free (i.e., not bound to a protein) glutamate. Foods with naturally occurring higher levels of free glutamate were also excluded from the diet (such as soy sauce and aged cheeses like parmesan). The additives excluded in this study are considered ‘excitotoxins’ due to their ability (when present in high enough amounts) to overexcite a neuron to the point that it dies [,]. Glutamate is the most ubiquitous neurotransmitter in mammalian systems, and disordered glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in many disorders, including OCD [,,], FM [,,,], and IBS [,]. The excitotoxin elimination diet used in this study required that subjects make one-for-one substitutions in the diet, replacing products which contained free glutamate, with other similar products which were free of these food additives, as opposed to improving the diet quality overall. For example, if a subject was consuming Doritos®, which can contain as many as 11 excitotoxins, they were asked to substitute these with simple corn tortilla chips, which have three ingredients: corn, oil and salt. This direct substitution removes the exposure to free glutamate, but does not increase the nutrient density of the diet.\\nAfter 1 month on the diet, subjects were again queried about their symptoms. Those who had >30% of their FM and IBS symptoms remit on the diet were eligible to go onto a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover challenge. Subjects came in fasting, and were randomized to receive monosodium glutamate (MSG) for three mornings of 1 week and placebo for 3 days of the other week. The main outcome measure was examining whether symptoms returned after each week of the crossover challenge. All fibromyalgia and IBS symptoms were formally assessed for remission (please see Holton et al. for a description of the measures []), while the subject's OCD symptoms were self-reported.\\nAt the end of the 1-month excitotoxin elimination diet, the 50-year-old subject reported complete remission of all of his symptoms, including those related to his OCD. He expressed profound surprise at the remission of his OCD symptoms in particular, reporting that no medication had ever been able to help his symptoms during the past 39 years. During the 2 challenge weeks, his symptoms returned when challenged with MSG (week 1), and did not return when challenged with placebo (week 2). Over the 3 days of exposure during the MSG challenge week, all of his symptoms returned at the end of day 1 and peaked on the evening of day 3. The symptoms then slowly subsided over the following 4 days. He reported that the OCD symptoms experienced during the challenge week were typical, again presenting as needing to perfect movements (in addition to the return of his fibromyalgia and IBS symptoms). This response during the double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges confirmed that it was the removal of free glutamate from the diet, as opposed to other inadvertent dietary changes, that resulted in symptom improvement.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: An 80-year-old man with known cervical canal stenosis due to ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament was transferred to an emergency room soon after a falling accident. The patient was alert and had complete tetraplegia, sensory deficits below the C4 cervical sensory level, and progressive restrictive respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation, and, eventually, a tracheostomy. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical cord compression that was worse at the C3–C4 intervertebral level, and an intramedullary high signal at C3 and C4 vertebral levels, and the patient was managed conservatively. During the conventional weaning process of trials of intermittent spontaneous breathing in the ICU, an unexpected cardiac arrest made both the patient and medical staff reluctant to proceed with further weaning. Fifty-eight days after cervical cord injury, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further rehabilitation. He was fully conscious and received pressure-support mechanical ventilation with back-up rates of 16 breaths. He had total tetraplegia below shoulder girdle muscles with a preserved sensation from C2 to C3 on both sides, and a urinary obstruction. The limbs and trunk were stiff with contracture, and muscle stretch reflexes of the limbs were abolished. Neurological level of injury was C3 according to the ISNCSCI, with a total sensory score of four. There was no sensory sacral sparing, while the deep anal pressure was preserved, and the American Spinal Injury Association scale graded B. Chest roentgenogram and computerized tomography showed bilateral, widespread atelectasis. The patient occasionally showed signs of pulmonary infection. Intensive pulmonary care and rehabilitation, including physical support for expectoration, mechanically assisted removal of tracheal secretions (CoughAssist E70®, Philips Japan, Tokyo), ventilator muscle training, and management of the spasticity of the abdominal wall, resulted in the improvement of the roentgenological findings. His expiratory tidal volume (VT) measured 150 mL.\\nAlthough the neurological status according to the ISNCSCI was unchanged, the patient was willing to be weaned from mechanical ventilation as his general condition improved. After informed consent was given, we attempted automated weaning from mechanical ventilation using IntelliVent®-ASV on and after 131 days of injury. IntelliVent®-ASV (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland) is a closed-loop ventilation mode that adjusts the pressure support in terms of the percentage of the ideal minute volume (%MV). The ideal MV (100%MV) is calculated from the patient’s height and gender. Based on Otis’ equation [], adaptive support ventilation will select the best VT–respiratory rate (RR) coupling for the optimal work of breathing. IntelliVent®-ASV has interrelated functions: an auto-adjustment for carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, an auto-adjustment for oxygenation, an auto-weaning tool named Quick Wean (QW), and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The setting of the target %MV is automated based on either the monitored end-tidal CO2 or monitored spontaneous breathing rate. The auto adjustment of fraction of inspiratory oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure is based on the monitored oxygen saturation fraction of hemoglobin with a pulse oximeter (SpO2) []. The QW mode is an optional automated weaning, and progressively reduces the pressure support, monitors for readiness-to-wean criteria, and provides the option to automatically conduct a fully controlled SBT. In the QW mode, when the spontaneous rate is less than the upper limit of the predicted target range, %MV is automatically decreased gradually to the selected level. To facilitate the recovery of VT by means of the loading work on respiratory muscles, we set the level of support to 70%MV for the QW mode. When spontaneous breathing satisfied the pre-determined conditions of oxygenation and ventilation for 1 min, the SBT mode was used. We operated the SBT mode during the day from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\\nIn the QW mode, the duration of 70%MV and SBT time (25%MV) increased gradually (Figs. and ). Twenty-two days after the introduction of the QW and SBT modes in association with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, SBT was running almost fully during the daytime. At this time, the expiratory VT was increased to 350 mL from 150 mL upon admission to our hospital. Thereafter, we withdrew the pressure support ventilation during the nighttime 39 days after the introduction of the auto-weaning mode, and the patient’s weaning process was completed.\n"
