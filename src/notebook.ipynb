She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region.

Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.\n",

(We resected three ribs where the 8th and 10th ribs were macroscopically free of the tumor. The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.)

The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place.

Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report.

He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient.

The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure.

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: Alright. We have taken some radiographs of your forearm and elbow. They showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: After your fall, you developed a hypertrophic nonunion of your ulnar shaft fracture, and we treated it with a cast for three months. But your motion through the nonunion site worsened, and you were unhappy with the functional limitations of your elbow arthrodesis.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: We discussed the surgical options for the ulna nonunion with you at your clinic visit three months after the fall, and we decided to proceed with conservative treatment for an additional three months.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I remember.\n",
      "Doctor: Due to your prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as the risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of the nonunion and the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would act as an intramedullary device.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, I understand.\n",
      "Doctor: During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position and a posterior incision was performed over your elbow. We had to elevate a prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at your index procedure. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: We performed a triceps splitting approach to your elbow joint and multiple buried pins were inserted.\n",
      "Patient: Alright.\n",
      "Doctor: Is there anything you don't understand or have any questions about the procedure?\n",
      "Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: You're welcome. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 35-year-old gravida 6, para 5 mother who is 38-week pregnant from last normal menstrual period has presented to Tercha General Hospital (a rural hospital in Southern Ethiopia). The patient is referred from a health center 60 kms far from this hospital for suspected “big baby” in labor. The patient was an illiterate housewife. In terms of past obstetrics history, all previous deliveries occurred at home vaginally with live birth with no major complication. During the index pregnancy, she had antenatal care visits at a nearby health center without ultrasound examination. She reports that the current pregnancy is heavier than previous ones and associated with significant discomfort than her previous pregnancy experiences. Otherwise, she has no self or family history of twinning in the past.\\nExamination shows a stable gravida with normal vital signs. Abdominal examination shows big for date uterus with two cephalic poles in the lower abdomen and positive fetal heartbeat. Standard ultrasound examination confirmed twin pregnancy with both in cephalic presentation and adequate amniotic fluid; single placenta with no visible dividing membrane; fetal heartbeat is visible at two sites and is in a normal range. Upon pelvic examination, the cervix is 8cm dilated with left occiput-anterior position at a station 0. Fetal membrane is ruptured with clear liquor passing. With diagnosis of twin pregnancy (both cephalic presenting), in active phase of first stage of labor patient is admitted to labor ward and management of labor started in the standard way.\\nIn the next few hours labor progressed well and the first baby is crowning. Duty midwives are attending the delivery. Subsequently, with maternal effort the head and upper extremities of the first baby are delivered and the remaining part of the fetus is delivered by ‘gentle' traction by the midwives. But after delivery of the whole body, baby 1 remained ‘attached' to the mothers' perineum, though the baby is crying vigorously (). The midwives started to shout for help and senior obstetrician arrived.\\nOn reevaluation, we noticed the same and we found that the anterior abdomen of baby 1 from xiphisternum to the site of umbilical cord insertion is continuous into the uterine cavity. This led to sudden and unexpected consideration of the possibility of conjoined twins. Bedside ultrasound showed alive remaining fetus with fetal heart rate of 76 and in a transverse lie with the head in the right iliac fossa and fetal dorsum anterior. Initial attempt to access the extremities and aid delivery of the remaining fetus vaginally is not possible due to failure to reach the extremities for intrauterine manipulation. Emergency laparotomy is decided.\\nEmergency laparotomy under general anesthesia with midline subumbilical abdominal incision and lower uterine segment vertical hysterotomy is performed. We corrected the lie of the born baby such that it is parallel to that of the unborn baby; with deep vaginal examination along with the caudal end of the attachment and managed to manipulate the lower extremities of the intrauterine fetus to vagina and after grasping those with the right hand vaginally, we brought it to the perineum. Then there is careful manipulation to bring those extremities posterior to the born baby with a second assistant holding and manipulating the born baby away from the area of manipulation. Progressive delivery of the second baby of the conjoined pairs is affected by total breech extraction with minimal difficulty.\\nBoth newborns were depressed at completion of the procedure and recovered after aggressive resuscitation for 10 minutes (). Both are male and their combined weight is 5800 gm. Ultrasound examination of the twins shows shared liver with no other organs shared. Latter the second baby passed away after 1 hour of stay at the NICU. The second baby died after 20 hours of stay, during transportation to higher center for possible emergency separation. The mother was discharged to home on her sixth post-op day after counseling.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 57-year-old male who had no family history of cancer complained of acute abdominal pain and fever and visited his local hospital. He was diagnosed with gastric perforation and referred to our hospital. We performed emergent surgery for peritonitis caused by a gastric perforation. We evaluated the abdominal cavity laparoscopically and found some cloudy ascites in the abdomen and a pin hole perforation at the anterior wall of the gastric antrum. Because the gastric wall around the perforation was thick and did not have any serous changes, it was difficult to assess whether the cause of the perforation was tumor related. The cytodiagnosis of ascites did not show any tumor cells. There was also a white nodule in the lateral segment of the liver, which was suspected to be a metastatic liver tumor. We performed a primary closure of the defect, applied an omentum flap and washed the abdominal cavity with 10 l of normal saline. The operation time was 120 min, and the volume of blood loss was 10 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful. We performed upper and lower endoscopy, which showed type II tumors in the gastric body (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, HER2 score 2+) (Fig. a, b) and transverse colon (well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, RAS mutation) (Fig. c, d), and we considered that the gastric perforation was related to the presence of advanced gastric tumors. Furthermore, the CT showed irregular wall thickness with ulcers in the gastric body, which were suspected to be gastric cancer with lymph node metastases at station no. 3, irregular wall thickness of the transverse colon (Fig. a–c), which was suspected to be colon cancer, and nodules in liver segments 2/3 (60 mm) and in segment 6 (57 mm) (Fig. a, b), which were suspected to be liver metastases. We retrospectively reevaluated the CT findings from a local hospital and detected liver nodules in segment 2/3 (35 mm) and segment 6 (26 mm), and the tumors had dramatically grown in size in only 2 months. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed colon cancer (maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 14.4) and multiple liver metastases (S2/S3, unclear SUVmax; S6, SUVmax 11.3), but 18F-FDG uptake was not found in the gastric tumor and lymph nodes (Fig. a–d). The serum blood tests showed normal tumor marker levels (carcinoembryonic antigen, 4.6 mg/dl; carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 20.7 mg/dl) and normal liver function. We diagnosed the patient with synchronous cStage IV (cT3cN0cM1) transverse colon cancer with multiple liver metastases and cStage IIB (cT3cN1cM0) gastric cancer according to the 7th edition TNM classification []. Because of the gastric cancer perforation and the dramatic enlargement of the liver metastasis, we believed that a complete resection of the tumors would be difficult, and that chemotherapy treatment would be important to control tumor progression. We chose SOX plus bevacizumab therapy (on day 1 of each 3-week cycle, 7.5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab and 130 mg/m2 intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin were administered along with a dose of S-1 60 mg/m2 twice a day starting after dinner on day 1 until after breakfast on day 15, followed by a 7-day break). After 10 courses, the patient presented with oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy [], and another 10 courses were administered without oxaliplatin. An endoscopic examination did not detect gastric cancer (Fig. a) or transverse colon cancer (Fig. b). The liver metastases were dramatically reduced in size to 14 mm in segment 2/3 and 15 mm in segment 6 (Fig. a, b), and the FDG PET/CT findings showed no 18F-FDG uptake in any of the tumors (Fig. c, d). The serum blood tests showed the elevated tumor marker levels (carcinoembryonic antigen, 12.6 mg/dl; carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 43.1 mg/dl). After chemotherapy, the clinical diagnoses were ycStage IV (ycT3ycN0ycM1) transverse colon cancer and ycStage IIa (ycT3ycN0ycM0) gastric cancer. We planned a two-step procedure to completely resect the primary tumors and multiple liver metastases. We first performed resection of the colon and gastric tumors. Intraoperatively, there were broad adhesions between the omentum and the abdominal wall. The cytodiagnosis of the ascites showed no atypical cells. A small white nodule in segment 6 was detected. No signs of a “blue liver” were detected. We first laparoscopically performed resection of the transverse colon cancer in the right-side colon along with D3 lymphadenectomy. Then, we performed open distal gastrectomy for the gastric tumor with D2 lymphadenectomy (Roux-en-Y anastomosis). The operation time was 605 min, and the volume of blood loss was 840 ml. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 18 and had an uneventful postoperative course. After 1 month, we performed liver resection for the multiple liver metastases. Intraoperatively, we detected tumors in segment 6 on the liver surface, and with sonography, we detected a tumor in segment 3, which was very close to the umbilical portion of the portal vein. We performed open lateral segment resection and partial resection at segment 3. The operation time was 402 min, and the volume of blood loss was 420 ml. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 12 without any remarkable complications. The pathological findings showed ypT2 (MP) tumors with grade 2 therapeutic effects in the transverse colon and no residual gastric tumor and multiple liver nodules (pathological complete response).\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: The present case report is about a 72-year-old male patient who reported with oral discomfort and difficulty in swallowing since past 5 months. He gave a history of soreness of the oral mucosa with burning sensation on eating spicy food since past 9 years, but his symptoms had exacerbated in the past 5 months. He now complained of sore throat and difficulty in swallowing solids since past few months forcing him to a semisolid and liquid bland diet. He complained of multiple ulcers in the mouth and enlarged swollen bleeding gums, which had not resolved with symptomatic treatment given by his physician (topical lignocaine gel and chlorhexidine mouthwash). He informed that several of his teeth had progressively become mobile and had spontaneously exfoliated in the past 2 years. The partial denture that he had been using had become tight and was painful on insertion in the oral cavity. He found it difficult to eat or speak clearly without his denture.\\nHe had been diagnosed with benign prostrate hyperplasia but was otherwise well and did not have any history of constitutional symptoms like fever, loss of appetite/weight, fatigue and arthralgia. He did not have any habits of smoking, tobacco and alcohol. There was no history of allergies or family history of similar condition. There was no history of skin, ocular or genital lesions. He did not have any systemic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and was not taking any regular systemic medications.\\nOn examination, there were erosive areas on the buccal mucosa, palate and tongue. There was no evidence of any vesicles, bullae or scarring and Nikolskys sign was negative. There was generalized inflammatory enlargement of the gingiva including the palate, extending into the pharynx. The gingiva, palatal and oropharyngeal mucosa was fiercely erythematous, edematous, with a cobble-stone like velvety shiny irregular surface which bled on palpation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity criteria for oral mucositis the oral condition of the patient was indicative of grade 3 of severe mucositis (ulcers, extensive erythema, patient cannot swallow solid diet). The maxillary and mandibular arches were edentulous posteriorly. The remaining anterior teeth were mobile with pathological migration, gingival recession and purulent discharge from the pockets [Figures and ]. The submandibular and submental lymph nodes were palpable, mobile and tender on palpation.\\nBased on the clinical findings, this condition could be due to local factors or it could be an oral manifestation of a systemic condition. The differential diagnosis considered is shown in .\\nFurther investigations were carried out after obtaining informed written consent from the patient. The results of the various investigations carried out are shown in .\\nBased on clinical, radiological [], histopathological findings [Figures –] and results of various investigations a diagnosis of PCM was made.\\nThe patient was prescribed topical corticosteroids (tablet betamethasone 1 mg as a mouthwash and gargles 4 times daily, Triamcinolone acetonide gel 0.1% for topical application 4 times daily). Symptomatic treatment for oral burning sensation (lidocaine gel) was prescribed for local application before meals to prevent discomfort while eating. The patient was followed-up weekly. At 2 months follow-up, there was only mild improvement in the oral burning sensation while the gingival bleeding had stopped. There was however no improvement in the erythematous, edematous appearance of the palatal and gingival lesions. The erosions in the buccal mucosa and tongue also persisted. The anterior teeth became progressively mobile and were extracted. The patient was then prescribed systemic corticosteroids (tablet prednisolone 60 mg once daily) along with topical application of corticosteroids and antifungal mouth paint. The patient was also prescribed proton pump inhibitors and calcium supplements prophylactically to prevent side-effects of long term corticosteroid therapy. The patient was followed weekly and at 2 months follow-up, the erosions in the buccal mucosa and tongue had resolved. There was significant improvement in the clinical appearance of the gingival, palatal and pharyngeal lesions on oral and endoscopic examination [Figures and ]. The patient reported improvement in swallowing food (able to swallow solids) and oral burning sensation. The oral condition was indicative of grade 1 according to the WHO toxicity criteria for oral mucositis (soreness ± erythema). The patient was also able to resume the use of complete dentures. The systemic steroid was gradually tapered off over the next 6 weeks. There was a relapse of the lesions in the following month. Attempts at surgical excision of the hyperplastic lesions in the gingiva and palate also resulted in recurrence. Topical application of tacrolimus (0.1%) or 2% fusidic acid also did not yield any results. The patient was restarted on systemic steroids and is now maintained on a dose of 10 mg of prednisolone and topical antifungals for the past 3 months. Attempts at further reduction of prednisolone results in relapse and increase in oral symptoms. Regular monitoring for side-effects of long term steroid therapy is carried out.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: Case 1: Ms. K, a 70-year-old woman who immigrated to the US at the age of 53, began complaining of watery eyes, chest pain, lower back and joint pain, leg cramps, and weakness. She harbored delusions of being afflicted with high blood pressure, uterine cancer, blood cancer with bone metastasis, brain cancer with extensive metastasis, and believed that her brain was \"shrinking.\"\\nShe first visited a cardiologist in 2013, complaining of intermittent episodes of chest pain over six months. An electrocardiogram (EKG) at the time showed bradycardia, a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and a left bundle branch block. At her sixth visit with the cardiologist, she mentioned non-specific somatic complaints, which she said were because of a \"hematological problem.\" Five months later, she was evaluated for “renal hypertension” and imaging studies showed a renal cyst. While she did not follow up with the nephrologist, she continued to make hospital visits for persistent chest pain. A full medical workup was completed and found to be normal at every ER visit. Medical records from a prior ER visit revealed that she had made claims that the Russian military entered her residence and stole her urine, resulting in the disappearance of her kidneys.\\nMs. K was brought to the ER by the police after she showed up with a can of gasoline and matches at her primary doctor's office and threatened to burn it down. She was irate and claimed that all of her doctors, in the US and in her home country, were concealing the fact that she had oncological issues. She vehemently denied any psychiatric illness, stating that these diagnoses appeared on her records as a result of a rumor started by an envious former colleague. She explained that because she had been a former practicing neurologist in her home country, she was confident that she had cancer. Upon repeated questioning, she admitted that in a final bid to receive the medical attention that she was rightfully due, she had devised the plan to burn down the doctor’s office.\\nWhile in the psychiatric inpatient unit, she remained somatically preoccupied and reported abdominal pain, lower back pain, and weakness, which she attributed to the metastatic spread of uterine cancer to her spine. Radiological imaging confirmed no evidence of uterine cancer, though a thickened endometrium was reported with recommendations for further testing by tissue sampling. Because Ms. K’s ability to make rational and reasonable decisions about her psychiatric and medical treatment was compromised by her delusions, the team sought and was granted a court order allowing them to treat her over her objection.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: An 11-year-old male in permanent dentition was reported with a chief complaint of missing upper front teeth. The patient had a convex profile and competent lips. On intraoral examination, the patient had a class 1 molar relationship bilaterally with missing maxillary right central and lateral incisors, retained deciduous canine, mandibular arch crowding, and retroclined maxillary left central and lateral incisors (). Routine panoramic radiograph revealed impacted incisors, unerupted canine, and a supernumerary tooth as well. Cone-beam computed tomography scan done to evaluate the shape and exact position of the supernumerary tooth revealed that it was lying between right central and lateral incisors. Cone-beam computed tomography scan also revealed the presence of dilaceration of impacted central incisor root which was curved distobuccally near the apical third (). The cause of impaction was established as an obstruction to the path of eruption due to supernumerary teeth.\\nThe treatment plan was the removal of deciduous canine, supernumerary tooth, and surgical exposure of impacted incisors and unerupted canine followed by evaluation at a later date for all first premolar extraction depending on the soft tissue profile.\\nAn open coil spring was placed post alignment to create space for the impacted incisor on an 018 round SS wire. An open eruption technique was planned as the tooth was below the mucogingival junction near the alveolar crest along with the extraction of deciduous canine and supernumerary teeth. The impacted incisor and unerupted canine were bonded at the same time as the exposure. Spontaneous eruption of the teeth occurred while space was maintained with an open coil NiTi spring. Over the next 3 months, the progress of incisor eruption was evaluated monthly. Once sufficiently erupted, the crown was bonded with an incisor bracket to align the maxillary arch (). Proximal stripping was done to relieve the crowding in the lower arch. The active treatment took 18 months. At the end of treatment, the upper and lower arches were aligned, there was a class 1 molar and class 1 canine relation ().\n"
