She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region.

Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.\n",

(We resected three ribs where the 8th and 10th ribs were macroscopically free of the tumor. The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.)

The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place.

Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report.

He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient.

The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure.

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.\n",

      "Doctor: I see. Your motor and sensory exam is normal at the hand, right?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: Alright. We have taken some radiographs of your forearm and elbow. They showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: After your fall, you developed a hypertrophic nonunion of your ulnar shaft fracture, and we treated it with a cast for three months. But your motion through the nonunion site worsened, and you were unhappy with the functional limitations of your elbow arthrodesis.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: We discussed the surgical options for the ulna nonunion with you at your clinic visit three months after the fall, and we decided to proceed with conservative treatment for an additional three months.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I remember.\n",
      "Doctor: Due to your prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as the risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of the nonunion and the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would act as an intramedullary device.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, I understand.\n",
      "Doctor: During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position and a posterior incision was performed over your elbow. We had to elevate a prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at your index procedure. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, okay.\n",
      "Doctor: We performed a triceps splitting approach to your elbow joint and multiple buried pins were inserted.\n",
      "Patient: Alright.\n",
      "Doctor: Is there anything you don't understand or have any questions about the procedure?\n",
      "Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: You're welcome. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 28-year-old male working as a tractor driver was brought to the Emergency surgical ward by his wife with complaints of cutting off at the left side at the base of his scrotum with a kitchen knife.\\nHis history revealed that patient has been taking arrack for the last 6 years. He started with 200 ml of arrack and slowly increased the amount to 1l over a period of 6 years as he was not getting the desired effect he used to get with 200 ml. On occasions, when he did not have the money or opportunity to drink, he used to experience dysphoric state including severe anxiety, palpitations sweating, restlessness, and tremors of hands. These symptoms used to subside upon taking alcohol.\\nHe also did not have any control over the amount of alcohol he is taking and the money he is spending on it once he started to drink. He also neglected his duties both at work and at home due to this habit, for which he had frequent quarrels with his wife and has also ended up in financial crisis with a big debt. Due to above mentioned problems two days before admission, patient decided to stop drinking alcohol and stopped all of a sudden and he has developed abnormal behavior like talking to self, not feeding self, not recognizing family members, and talking irrelevantly. He started to complain that he is hearing voices of male and female when no one around.\\nOn the morning of the day of admission, patient went to the kitchen and cut his scrotum at the base with a knife on left side. The dimensions 2×3 inches with a depth of 1 inch. After amputation, patient did not talk to anyone and sat all alone. His wife after one hour saw blood stains on floor and on his groins and brought him to casualty. After suturing the wound, the patient was referred to psychiatry op. The Mental status examination of the patient showed that the patient is not co-operative, not oriented to time, place, and person, hence cognitive functions could not done. He was diagnosed as Mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol withdrawal state, complicated with delirium. The patient was admitted in psychiatry ward, all the investigations done like complete blood picture, liver function tests, blood urea, serum electrolytes, and Computed Tomography (CT) scan brain to rule out any organic cause. They started on tablet Chlordiazepoxide 200 mg in divided doses, tablet Thiamine 150 mg both given orally in divided doses to prevent Korsakoff's psychosis and injection Lorazepam 2 mg IM on sos basis to prevent any agitation. The patient became oriented on the 4th day of admission and then stared to complain of pain at injury site for which he was started on Non steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs. Mental status examination then done showed that the patient's cognition was normal.\\nThere were no adverse effects like infection of the injury or cutting of the cord or vas deferens and the wound completely healed in a period of 3 weeks. For next ten days, we slowly tapered off the Chlordiazepoxide and on the 10th day of admission, patient was discharged on tablet Disulfiram. The patient is on regular follow-up now for last 8 months and completely abstinent from alcohol.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: The patient reported is a 59-year-old man with a past medical history of seizure disorder and multiple inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations for manic and depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. During these prior hospitalizations, no coprophagia was reported. He was admitted to the inpatient service for an acute episode of psychotic depression with complaints of a depressed mood. He exhibited psychomotor retardation, impoverished thought content, anhedonia, and a disheveled malodorous appearance but was oriented to person, place, and time.\\nIn the course of index hospitalization, coprophagia was noted during his first day of admission, with staff observing him defecating and consuming his feces multiple times during the day despite being placed on urgent 1:1 constant observation. Initial assessment was limited as the patient had impoverished speech and was unable to communicate possible reasons for his behavior. Laboratory work-up for possible organic etiology was only significant for a slightly low total iron binding capacity as he had an otherwise normal metabolic panel and complete blood count. Urine toxicology was negative for alcohol and illicit drugs. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal showing only minimal periventricular and subcortical white matter lucencies, compatible with minimal chronic microvascular ischemic changes.\\nHe was commenced on risperidone 2 milligrams twice daily. There was a slight improvement within the first week as he was better at communicating, but his coprophagic behavior continued unabated. The slight improvement in thought content and process enabled him to express the symptoms associated with his coprophagia. He reported command auditory hallucinations resulting in the urge to consume feces, followed by the release of guilt and tension after consumption. In addition, he expressed excessive guilt in regard to his forensic history, being a registered sexual offender, with prior incarceration for lewd conduct with three female minors. He believed his consumption of feces was a necessary retribution for his behavior, to prevent “god and society from imposing worse punishments” on him. Over the next few days on the inpatient unit, risperidone was cross-tapered with clozapine which was started at 25 mg and titrated to 125 mg per day over 12 days. Cognitive therapy was also used to explore his automatic feelings associated with his forensic history during this time period. He was compliant with both interventions. Over the course of the cross-taper and cognitive therapy, the patient reported resolution of the command hallucinations to consume feces and his excessive guilty feelings. This was accompanied by an improvement in his coprophagic behavior.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 55-year-old woman who presented with gross hematuria was admitted to our department for a slow-growing right renal mass monitored over time by computed tomography (CT). Chondrosarcoma of the left scapula was diagnosed 15 years earlier. She presented with left shoulder pain, and a left scapula X-ray revealed a 7 cm mass with calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed a low signal on T1-weighted and a high signal on T2-weighted. She underwent scapula and humerus wide margin resection of the primary tumor with artificial humeral head replacement. The tumor was composed of cartilage cells growing a lobular architecture with eosinophilic reticulum and myxoid stromal tissue and was diagnosed as Grade 2 chondrosarcoma (). Initial surgical treatment showed no evidence of a residual tumor in the disease area and was deemed a successful surgery. Two years after the initial resection, she developed a local recurrence in the left scapula and subsequently underwent extensive resection surgery for both the tumor and clavicle. No residual tumor was detected following surgery. In the following year, multiple bilateral lung nodule shadows appeared on CT. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was performed after being diagnosed with metastatic chondrosarcoma to the lung. She proceeded to undergo 13 RFA procedures for lung metastatic chondrosarcoma, with the RFA procedure being performed by an experienced radiologist at our institute. Cooled RFA electrodes (Cool-tip, Valleylab) with a 2 or 3 cm exposed tip were connected to a generator (series CC-1-100, Valleylab) and were inserted into the tumor. Power was applied for a period of 10-12 min using an impedance control algorithm []. Six years after RFA treatment, following multiple treatments to the same lesion, VATS was again conducted for a left upper lobe lung metastasis refractory tumor. She then underwent six additional RFA procedures for metastatic chondrosarcoma to bilateral lower lung lobes over the next 5 years. In total, she received 19 RFA and 2 VATS procedures for lung metastases. No relapse of the pulmonary metastasis occurred in 4 years prior to being admitted to our department.\\nAt the time of admission to the urology department, the patient's laboratory results were within normal ranges, except for the presence of red blood cells in the urinalysis. Three years before the latest admission, CT revealed a cystic tumor in the upper half of the right kidney. Over a period of 3 years, the cyst developed from 14 mm to 46 mm. No septa or calcifications were observed in the tumor (). Hydronephrosis was not present, and the right ureter was normal. The patient did not undergo a contrast-enhanced CT due to iodine allergy. A 45 mm cystic tumor without septa, calcifications, or solid components was seen in the upper pole of the right kidney on MRI, displaying a low signal on T1-weighted and a high signal on T2-weighted MRI. Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI showed rim enhancement. Contrast-enhanced images showed a thick, slightly enhanced cystic wall, and the tumor was classified as a Bosniak IIF cystic renal lesion (). Retrograde pyelography demonstrated a solitary filling defect in the upper pole of the right renal pelvis (). Urine cytology demonstrated low-grade malignant cells with a light green stained large reticulum and a mucus-like substance (). The preoperative differential diagnosis included cystic renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal pelvis, and metastatic chondrosarcoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, partial cystectomy, and regional lymph node resection. Macroscopically, the resected specimen contained a well-circumscribed tumor measuring 5 × 4 cm. The tumor involved the renal pelvis, and the cut surface of the tumor was white and jelly-like (). Histopathological findings showed a myxoid tumor in the tumor wall that invaded the renal pelvis. A cartilaginous tumor composed of atypical cartilage cells was observed. No tumor cells were present in the ureter. Considering the primary tumor pathological findings, we hypothesized that the tumor was composed of cartilage cells with a high cell density and enlarged nuclei (). The tumor cells were positive for toluidine blue staining, confirming a cartilaginous component (). The kidney tumor was also diagnosed as Grade 2 chondrosarcoma (). The resected lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. The final pathological diagnosis was chondrosarcoma metastasis to the kidney. The patient's postoperative course is promising, and she has remained disease-free for over 18 months of follow-up.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: The present case report is about a 40-year-old male patient presented with the complaints of swelling in the right temporal region for 4 months. On detailed evaluation, he gave a history of dental infection leading to tooth extraction following which the swelling started. In addition, he also complained of holocranial headache of 15 days duration. On examination, the swelling was 3 × 3 × 4 cm in size and was non pulsatile, soft and fluctuant with ill-defined and diffuse borders. A small defect was palpable in the right parietal bone posterior to the swelling. At 24 h after admission, he developed sinuses over the swelling that were discharging pus. CT head revealed a defect of size 2 × 2 cm in the right parietal bone with irregular margins and the defect was involving both the inner and outer tables. The bony edge was undermined with an extradural collection of size 0.5 × 0.5 cm [Figure and ]. There was a collection within the right temporal muscle that was extending down into the infrazygomatic region suggestive of an abscess []. MRI revealed a T1 hypo T2 hyperintense well defined lesion situated within the right temporalis muscle and an extradural heterointense lesion below the bony defect [Figure and ]. However there was no evidence of intracranial extension. Bone scan of the patient was done and showed increased uptake in the right parietal bone suggestive of osteomyelitis. However as it could be either pyogenic or tubercular in etiology, a detailed evaluation for TB was undertaken. His chest X-ray showed a well-defined opacity in the right upper lobe. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 60 mm at the end of 1st h and Mantoux was positive. TB interferon gamma was done and was positive. Since he had a discharging sinus and a temporal collection he was posted for surgery. A right sided reverse question mark incision was made exposing the temporalis muscle and the defect in the right parietal bone. A large portion of the temporalis muscle was replaced by necrosed tissue and pus []. The pus was extending inferiorly to involve the temporalis muscle below the zygoma. Thorough debridement of the devitalized tissue was done. The defect in the parietal bone was nibbled all around and sent for histopathological examination. There was granulation tissue located extradurally just beneath the defect. It was scooped out and sent for biopsy. After debridement, saline and betadine irrigation was done and the wound closed. Patient was started on antitubercular therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin as he was not receiving any antibiotics prior to surgery. Microscopy was negative for Grams staining and cultures were sterile. Histopathology report came as caseating granulomas with epitheloid cells, Langhans giant cells with acid fast bacilli seen. Post-operative period was uneventful. Sutures were removed on the 7th post-operative day and patient was discharged. At a follow-up of 4 weeks, patient has no swelling and the wound is well-healed.\n",

      "│ ├─full_note: A 45-year-old man presented to our department with rapidly progressive swelling of the anterior neck. He had been a 40-pack-year smoker. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.5 cm tumor that was enhanced slightly in the left lobe of the thyroid (). At first, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid tumor suggested anaplastic carcinoma. Thereafter, we performed a left lobectomy of the thyroid to prevent fatal airway obstruction from the rapid tumor growth and to make a histological diagnosis. However, pathological examination of the thyroid tumor revealed two distinct neoplasia types (): half of the tumor showed solid growth of small cells with round-to-oval nuclei and scant cytoplasm (), and the other half was composed of nests and rosettes of polygonal cells with enlarged round-to-oval and prominent nuclei (). The specimen stained positively for synaptophysin, CD 56, and chromogranin A via immunohistochemistry (). These findings were consistent with NEC composed of small-cell and large-cell carcinoma [], which is generally an indicator of metastasis from another organ. A whole-body CT performed to identify a primary NEC revealed a 7 cm tumor in the liver and a 3 cm tumor in the transverse colon (); however, no tumors were detected in the lung. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy revealed that the liver tumor was histopathologically the same type as that of the thyroid tumor, while the transverse colon tumor was found to be an adenocarcinoma based on colonoscopic biopsy. We performed colon cancer resection to prevent intestinal obstruction as palliative care. Surprisingly, two distinct areas of histological features were found in the colon specimen: well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and NEC similar to that in the thyroid and the liver (). In addition, immunohistochemistry of the entire specimen revealed that synaptophysin and CD5 were positive in the NEC component and partially positive in the adenocarcinoma component. These findings suggested that the colon tumor was MiNEN with the adenocarcinoma and NEC components derived from the same cell of origin and the NEC component of the colon MiNEN metastasized to the thyroid and the liver [, ].\\nChemotherapy was planned for the residual metastatic liver tumor based on a regimen for small-cell lung cancer: six cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and irinotecan as the first line, six cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide as the second line, and eight cycles of amrubicin as the third line. Disease progression was observed after the third line, which required an extensive right hepatic lobectomy and resection of the inferior vena cava. The elevated serum level of NSE and ProGRP (120 ng/ml and 59.8 pg/ml, respectively) returned to normal after hepatic lobectomy. The patient showed no evidence of disease recurrence for 7 years of follow-up after the hepatic surgery.\n"
